# Spec 020 — Gemini provider: usage-only adapter

Status: **Done**

Plan: `plans/002-multi-provider/` (research `02-gemini.md`, synthesis `10-adapter-plan.md` §2 —
verdict YELLOW, usage-only, after z.ai). Local chats JSON/JSONL shapes were re-verified against
real files under `~/.gemini/tmp/**` on 2026-07-19 (see §B below — the first verification pass
quoted an elided excerpt that hid the envelope and the event-sourced `.jsonl` structure).

## Motivation

Official gemini-cli writes per-turn token counts to local session files — a direct analog of the
Codex sessions lane (spec 013), ToS-safe. No scriptable limits/quota surface exists (the daily
request ceiling resets at midnight Pacific and is exposed nowhere machine-readable), so v1 is
**usage-only**: real token counts, both gauges honestly `n/a`, no invented cost. The account
activates once a Google-account-OAuth gemini-cli login exists on this machine.

## Behaviour

### A. Provider + config contract

- `Provider::Gemini` (string `"gemini"`) round-trips config → store → display.
- Config: `config_dir` **required** (the `GEMINI_CLI_HOME` dir, default `~/.gemini`),
  `api_key_env` **rejected** (an API-key Gemini setup is PAYG, not a subscription — same
  exclusion as a raw Anthropic Console key). `limits_overlay` is accepted but **ignored** (no
  limits surface exists); `doctor` states this so a set flag isn't a silent mystery.

### B. Usage lane (local, ToS-safe)

- `providers/gemini/chats.rs` — pure parse + reduce over
  `<config_dir>/tmp/<project-hash>/chats/session-*.json[l]`. **Real file shapes** (re-verified
  2026-07-19 against `~/.gemini/tmp/**`, machine — not the elided excerpt the first pass quoted):
  - `.json` is a **session wrapper OBJECT**: `{sessionId, projectHash, startTime, lastUpdated,
    messages: [...]}`. Each turn's `tokens`/`timestamp` live on an element of `messages`, mixed
    with token-less user-message elements that must be filtered out individually, never fail the
    whole document.
  - `.jsonl` is **event-sourced**, not one line per finished turn: a header line (`sessionId`/
    `projectHash`/no `tokens`), `{"$set": {...}}` envelope-patch lines (skipped explicitly), and
    the SAME message `id` re-appended across multiple lines as it's updated (once on creation,
    again once `tokens` lands, sometimes again with `toolCalls`). Events **must be deduped by
    `id`, last occurrence wins**, before reduction — undeduped summation double-counts a real
    session (verified: one real file overcounted `total_tokens` by +62%, 61,190 vs. the true
    37,648).
  - Malformed lines/elements degrade per-line/per-element, never fail the account.
  - Per-turn `tokens` shape (once isolated from the envelope): `{input, output, cached, thoughts,
    tool, total}` alongside `id`, `timestamp`, `model` (observed invariant: `total = input +
    output + thoughts + tool`, `cached ⊆ input`). An all-zero `tokens` object is not a real turn.
  - Bucket mapping: `input = input − cached` (floor 0), `cache_read = cached`,
    `output = output + thoughts` (reasoning folds into output, as Codex), `cache_creation = 0`,
    `total_tokens = tokens.total`. **`tool` folds into the input bucket** (tool results are
    prompt-side context — an assumption `[NEEDS CLARIFICATION]` until a real `tool > 0` fixture
    exists); the acceptance test asserts buckets sum to `total_tokens` regardless of placement.
  - `cost_notional = None` (no public subscription pricing basis — never fabricate),
    `window = None` (the 5h lookback is a scan bound, not a window claim — same posture as
    Codex).
- `GeminiAdapter`: fan-out glob across all `tmp/*/chats/` project hashes with per-file mtime
  pruning (bounded scan, spec-013 §B discipline). Missing `tmp/` ⇒ `Ok(None)` idle (fresh
  install, not an error). A logged-out account stops producing sessions ⇒ idle.

### C. No limits lane

- No overlay code, no new `LimitKind` (`Daily` explicitly deferred — a derived
  midnight-Pacific counter is out of scope until Robert wants a `Derived`-badged approximation).
- Both gauges render `n/a` — exactly the un-opted-in Codex render. A daily request ceiling must
  never be dressed up as a Session gauge.

### D. Surfaces

- TUI: usage row (tokens, no cost), both gauges `n/a`; ledger clause + verified pill work
  unchanged for a matching id. Fleet reductions: `cost_notional = None` never poisons the fleet
  cost line (existing None-handling reused).
- `tok doctor`: `config_dir` exists; `gemini --version` runs (argv subprocess, timeout, output
  never parsed beyond success); `oauth_creds.json` **existence only** (content never read);
  the ignored-`limits_overlay` note when set.
- `tok accounts` / `tok once --json`: gemini account appears like any account; R16 goldens
  (claude/codex fixtures) stay byte-identical.

## Non-goals

- Any limits/quota code, `LimitKind::Daily`, or derived gauges.
- Cost display; parsing Google's undocumented Code Assist HTTP API.
- Reading OAuth credential contents; auto-login.
- Multi-account `GEMINI_CLI_HOME` isolation promises (read-from-source but not two-account
  verified — not claimed until exercised).
- New external dependencies (fs + serde only).

## Acceptance criteria

1. `"gemini"` round-trips config → domain → store → display; validation: `config_dir` required,
   `api_key_env` rejected with the account named; existing provider validations stay green. (A)
2. Parser handles the real `.json` session-wrapper shape and the real `.jsonl` event-sourced
   shape (header line, `$set` patch lines, duplicate-id re-appends); skips malformed/non-turn
   lines and elements defensively; **dedups events by message id (last occurrence wins)**,
   asserted on a synthetic duplicate-id `.jsonl` fixture; reduce sums only in-window turns;
   buckets sum to `total_tokens` (incl. a `tool > 0` synthetic fixture); no events ⇒ `None`. (B)
3. Adapter on a fixture tree spanning multiple project hashes returns the merged snapshot;
   mtime pruning skips stale files (asserted); missing `tmp/` ⇒ `Ok(None)`. (B)
4. `cost_notional = None` flows through store and fleet reduction without poisoning the fleet
   cost line. (D)
5. TUI snapshot: tokens shown, both gauges `n/a`, no cost line, no derived anything; ledger
   clause + pill render for a matching id. (C, D)
6. `doctor`: dir check, `gemini --version` probe (with timeout), `oauth_creds.json` existence
   line, ignored-overlay note. `tok accounts` / `tok once --json` byte-identical to R16
   goldens. (D)
7. `./check.sh` green.
